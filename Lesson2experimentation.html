    <h3>Week 3</h3>
<h4>Random paragraph:</h4>
    <p><em>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language,</em> is the backbone of every webpage on the internet. It provides the basic structure, acting as the foundation upon which everything else is built. HTML uses a series of tags to define different elements, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags are like containers that tell the browser how to display content. While HTML alone doesn't make a page visually appealing—CSS handles that—it organizes the content logically, making it easy for both users and search engines to understand. It's simple to learn but incredibly powerful, forming the core of web development and laying the groundwork for any website or web application.</p>
